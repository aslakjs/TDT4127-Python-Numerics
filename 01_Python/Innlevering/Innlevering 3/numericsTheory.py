# # Theory - Numerics exercise 3

# ### a)
# How can one deduce the secant method from Newton's method

# The secant method can be thought of as a finite-difference approximation of Newton's method.

# ### b)
# Will Newton's method always converge to a zero?

# No

# ### c)
# If no derivative is available, which method should you choose - Newton's method or the secant method?

# Secant method

# ### d)
# Which method is the safest to use - Newton's method, the secant method or the bisection method?

# Bisection method

# ### e) 
# Which method is the slowest to use - Newton's method, the secant method or the bisection method?

# Bisection
